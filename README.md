Only 1 specialization, so changing it in a village just doesn't work. 

Class info: 
The monk class is barehanded fighter. You can't equip any weapons but you can equip any armor you find. Your damage starts at a base of 5 and ~6% of your max hp gets added to damage, which feels balanced. Your shift ability lays down a trail of fire, in exchange for mana. You also never lose mana over time, only when using your shift ability! Your ultimate gives you max hp (and you can use it while alive AND dead to revive yourself, not as broken as you might think!) and also invisibility for a bit to help you get out of a dangerous situation you just died in.

Installation:
Use with Chris's latest mod launcher version https://github.com/ChrisMiuchiz/Cube-World-Mod-Launcher/releases. Just put the LichModsMonkClass.dll into your mods folder. Basically, your Cube World folder should contain "CubeModLoader.fip" and a "Mods" folder. Your "Mods" folder should contain LichModsMonkClass.dll. 

KNOWN BUGS:
DO NOT open chests (unless it's for an artifact). If it tries to give you a weapon, you will crash. 
Crafting tabs are broken right now and you can't really craft.
*Maayyybbeee* getting hit by enemy abilities can crash the game? I think I fixed all cases of this, but if the game crashes while in combat, let me know what enemy and ability they used if possible.
You don't actually show as invis when you ult, just accept it. It lasts for about 15-20 sec so a mob not already aggro'd on you won't see you during that time unless you punch it.
