How to play: Make a new character and select Monk as your class. Then switch your specialization (or else abilities will not work!).

Some things to note: The monk class is barehanded fighter. You can't equip any weapons but you can equip *any* armor you find. Your damage starts at a base of 5 and ~6% of your max hp gets added to damage, which feels balanced. Your shift ability lays down a trail of fire, in exchange for mana. You also never lose mana over time, only when using your shift ability! Your ultimate gives you max hp (and you can use it while alive AND dead to revive yourself, not as broken as you might think!) and also invisibility for a bit to help you get out of a dangerous situation you just died in.
