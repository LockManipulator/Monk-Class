Only 1 specialization, so changing it in a village just doesn't work. 

Class info: 
The monk class is barehanded fighter. You can't equip any weapons but you can equip any armor you find. Your damage starts at a base of 5 and ~6% of your max hp gets added to damage, which feels balanced. Your shift ability lays down a trail of fire, in exchange for mana. You also never lose mana over time, only when using your shift ability! Your ultimate gives you max hp and you can use it while alive AND dead to revive yourself, not as broken as you might think!

Installation:
Use with Chris's latest mod launcher version https://github.com/ChrisMiuchiz/Cube-World-Mod-Launcher/releases. Just put the LichModsMonkClass.dll into your mods folder. Basically, your Cube World folder should contain "CubeModLoader.fip" and a "Mods" folder. Your "Mods" folder should contain LichModsMonkClass.dll. 

KNOWN BUGS:
Crafting tabs are broken right now and you can't really craft.
